\section{Part I. Poly-alphabetic Ciphers}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The plaintext message you managed to decipher
  \item Describe the stragey you employed, show the details for each of the
    steps of that strategy, describe any programs you wrote show sample output
    of these programs, and show how you transformed that output into your
    solution.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task 2: Test cases}
\subsection{Task 3: SDES and TripleDES keys}
The bits making up the keys of the SDES and TripleDES in task3

Describe the filtering strategy you used to know that the keys are correct.

\section{Conclusion}

A short paragraph that restates the objective from your introduction and
relates it to your results and discussion describes any future improvements on
your techniques that you would recommend.
