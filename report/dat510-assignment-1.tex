\section{Part I. Poly-alphabetic Ciphers}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The plaintext message you managed to decipher
  \item Describe the stragey you employed, show the details for each of the
    steps of that strategy, describe any programs you wrote show sample output
    of these programs, and show how you transformed that output into your
    solution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Part II. Simplified DES}

\subsection{Task 1: Test cases}

Implemented SDES and completed the following table.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline \textbf{Raw key} &
           \textbf{Plaintext} &
           \textbf{Ciphertext} \\

\subsection{Task 3: Cracking SDES and TripleDES}

\paragraph{SDES encrypted file} named \texttt{cxt1.txt} was decrypted with the
following result:

\paragraph{Key} \texttt{1111101010} or \texttt{0x3ea}

\paragraph{Plaintext}
\texttt{simplifieddesisnotsecureenoughtoprovideyousufficientsecurity}

\paragraph{Plaintext with manually inserted spaces}
\texttt{simplified des is not secure enough to provide you sufficient security}

Since the key is only 10 bits, I brute-forced it. I started with a set of all
the possible 1023 keys, then for each byte, I tried to decrypt with each key.
Assuming that the output text would be ASCII, I checked if the output byte was
within the printable ASCII range of 32--126. If it wasn't, the key was
immediately removed from the set. When the set contained a single key, I
stopped and printed the output.

\section{Conclusion}

A short paragraph that restates the objective from your introduction and
relates it to your results and discussion describes any future improvements on
your techniques that you would recommend.
